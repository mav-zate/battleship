	General sentiment:
		lots of jumping back and forth between functions

		

	Frustration:
		24/2/2017 getting the damn nested for loops to allow me to check two lists:
			fleet coordinates and prospective coordinates

		5/3/2017 after being able to generate a fleet of battleships, had to code uniqueness. Wrote code to fix this, and to check, I marked coordinates on the board a ship was located with the letter 's', but then I noticed configurations that suggested overlapping. After half an hour of checking to see what's wrong with direction_checker function when in fact nothing wrong, I realized that I had never checked initial point (just took for granted)

		11/3/2017 When implementing GUI I realized the importance of being "generous with data structures" and making code modular. After reading through "Hide and Seak.py" I realized that my code did not have the appropriate data structures to support a GUI
