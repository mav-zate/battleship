## battleship

This is a desktop version of the board game Battleship I designed using python and the [pygame module][pygame-download], which must be downloaded for the game to run succesfully.  
To run the game, go the main directory and type the following command into the command line:  
`python2.7-32 main.py`

(Running simply `python main.py` will not work because this version of [pygame][pygame-download] is the 32 bit one)
